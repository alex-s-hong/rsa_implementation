### RSA Implementation by going through the steps
1. Project Description

This project is to build an RSA public/private cryptosystem and use it for creating digital certificates and authentication.

As part of the assignment of Applied Cryptography & Network Security (CSCI-GA 3205-001), line numbers are given to point out which step has been processed for following results.



2. Description for the execution

Given `/outputs` directory, `main.py`,and `run.sh` file, `output[n]` are generated into the directory of `/outputs`.
(If there are any text files with name of output1, output2, ..., output20, it will not be able to execute.)

If run.sh is not executable, change the access permission of the file by typing,
   ```chmod +x run.sh```

In order to see the result in terminal window, simply type ```python3 main.py``` (or ```python main.py``` if the default python is python3)

The main.py is built in python version of 3.7.
