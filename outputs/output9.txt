Number|93|00000000000000000000000001011101

Miller-Rabin Algorithm for testing whether given number is prime or not.
Case 1. Non-prime number given.
n = 117, a = 8
i |xi |z   |y   |y
6 |1  |1   |1   |8
5 |1  |8   |64  |44
4 |1  |44  |64  |44
3 |0  |44  |64  |64
2 |1  |64  |1   |
1 |0  |    |    |
0 |0  |    |    |
117 is not a prime because 64^2 mod 117 = 1 and 64 != 1 and 64 != 117 - 1

Case 2. Prime number given.
n = 103, a = 93
i |xi |z   |y   |y
6 |1  |1   |1   |93
5 |1  |93  |100 |30
4 |0  |30  |76  |76
3 |0  |76  |8   |8
2 |1  |8   |64  |81
1 |1  |81  |72  |1
0 |0  |1   |1   |1
103 is perhaps a prime
