Miller-Rabin Algorithm for testing whether given number is prime or not.
Case 1. Non-prime number given.
n = 119, a = 8
i |xi |z   |y   |y
6 |1  |1   |1   |8
5 |1  |8   |64  |36
4 |1  |36  |106 |15
3 |0  |15  |106 |106
2 |1  |106 |50  |43
1 |1  |43  |64  |36
0 |0  |36  |106 |106
119 is not a prime because 8^118 mod 119 != 1

Case 2. Prime number given.
n = 107, a = 83
i |xi |z   |y   |y
6 |1  |1   |1   |83
5 |1  |83  |41  |86
4 |0  |86  |13  |13
3 |1  |13  |62  |10
2 |0  |10  |100 |100
1 |1  |100 |49  |1
0 |0  |1   |1   |1
107 is perhaps a prime
