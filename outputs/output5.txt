Miller-Rabin Algorithm for testing whether given number is prime or not.
Case 1. Non-prime number given.
n = 65, a = 2
i |xi |z   |y   |y
6 |1  |1   |1   |2
5 |0  |2   |4   |4
4 |0  |4   |16  |16
3 |0  |16  |61  |61
2 |0  |61  |16  |16
1 |0  |16  |61  |61
0 |0  |61  |16  |16
65 is not a prime because 2^64 mod 65 != 1

Case 2. Prime number given.
n = 103, a = 101
i |xi |z   |y   |y
6 |1  |1   |1   |101
5 |1  |101 |4   |95
4 |0  |95  |64  |64
3 |0  |64  |79  |79
2 |1  |79  |61  |84
1 |1  |84  |52  |102
0 |0  |102 |1   |1
103 is perhaps a prime
