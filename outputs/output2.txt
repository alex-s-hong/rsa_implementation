Miller-Rabin Algorithm for testing whether given number is prime or not.
Case 1. Non-prime number given.
n = 77, a = 12
i |xi |z   |y   |y
6 |1  |1   |1   |12
5 |0  |12  |67  |67
4 |0  |67  |23  |23
3 |1  |23  |67  |34
2 |1  |34  |1   |
1 |0  |    |    |
0 |0  |    |    |
77 is not a prime because 34^2 mod 77 = 1 and 34 != 1 and 34 != 77 - 1

Case 2. Prime number given.
n = 97, a = 86
i |xi |z   |y   |y
6 |1  |1   |1   |86
5 |1  |86  |24  |27
4 |0  |27  |50  |50
3 |0  |50  |75  |75
2 |0  |75  |96  |96
1 |0  |96  |1   |1
0 |0  |1   |1   |1
97 is perhaps a prime
