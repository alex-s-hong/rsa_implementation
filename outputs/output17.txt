Miller-Rabin Algorithm for testing whether given number is prime or not.
Case 1. Non-prime number given.
n = 75, a = 10
i |xi |z   |y   |y
6 |1  |1   |1   |10
5 |0  |10  |25  |25
4 |0  |25  |25  |25
3 |1  |25  |25  |25
2 |0  |25  |25  |25
1 |1  |25  |25  |25
0 |0  |25  |25  |25
75 is not a prime because 10^74 mod 75 != 1

Case 2. Prime number given.
n = 97, a = 96
i |xi |z   |y   |y
6 |1  |1   |1   |96
5 |1  |96  |1   |96
4 |0  |96  |1   |1
3 |0  |1   |1   |1
2 |0  |1   |1   |1
1 |0  |1   |1   |1
0 |0  |1   |1   |1
97 is perhaps a prime
