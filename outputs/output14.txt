Miller-Rabin Algorithm for testing whether given number is prime or not.
Case 1. Non-prime number given.
n = 111, a = 6
i |xi |z   |y   |y
6 |1  |1   |1   |6
5 |1  |6   |36  |105
4 |0  |105 |36  |36
3 |1  |36  |75  |6
2 |1  |6   |36  |105
1 |1  |105 |36  |105
0 |0  |105 |36  |36
111 is not a prime because 6^110 mod 111 != 1

Case 2. Prime number given.
n = 73, a = 70
i |xi |z   |y   |y
6 |1  |1   |1   |70
5 |0  |70  |9   |9
4 |0  |9   |8   |8
3 |1  |8   |64  |27
2 |0  |27  |72  |72
1 |0  |72  |1   |1
0 |0  |1   |1   |1
73 is perhaps a prime
