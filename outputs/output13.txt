Miller-Rabin Algorithm for testing whether given number is prime or not.
Case 1. Non-prime number given.
n = 85, a = 8
i |xi |z   |y   |y
6 |1  |1   |1   |8
5 |0  |8   |64  |64
4 |1  |64  |16  |43
3 |0  |43  |64  |64
2 |1  |64  |16  |43
1 |0  |43  |64  |64
0 |0  |64  |16  |16
85 is not a prime because 8^84 mod 85 != 1

Case 2. Prime number given.
n = 83, a = 81
i |xi |z   |y   |y
6 |1  |1   |1   |81
5 |0  |81  |4   |4
4 |1  |4   |16  |51
3 |0  |51  |28  |28
2 |0  |28  |37  |37
1 |1  |37  |41  |1
0 |0  |1   |1   |1
83 is perhaps a prime
