Miller-Rabin Algorithm for testing whether given number is prime or not.
Case 1. Non-prime number given.
n = 69, a = 3
i |xi |z   |y   |y
6 |1  |1   |1   |3
5 |0  |3   |9   |9
4 |0  |9   |12  |12
3 |0  |12  |6   |6
2 |1  |6   |36  |39
1 |0  |39  |3   |3
0 |0  |3   |9   |9
69 is not a prime because 3^68 mod 69 != 1

Case 2. Prime number given.
n = 113, a = 90
i |xi |z   |y   |y
6 |1  |1   |1   |90
5 |1  |90  |77  |37
4 |1  |37  |13  |40
3 |0  |40  |18  |18
2 |0  |18  |98  |98
1 |0  |98  |112 |112
0 |0  |112 |1   |1
113 is perhaps a prime
