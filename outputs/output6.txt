Miller-Rabin Algorithm for testing whether given number is prime or not.
Case 1. Non-prime number given.
n = 117, a = 4
i |xi |z   |y   |y
6 |1  |1   |1   |4
5 |1  |4   |16  |64
4 |1  |64  |1   |
3 |0  |    |    |
2 |1  |    |    |
1 |0  |    |    |
0 |0  |    |    |
117 is not a prime because 64^2 mod 117 = 1 and 64 != 1 and 64 != 117 - 1

Case 2. Prime number given.
n = 109, a = 116
i |xi |z   |y   |y
6 |1  |1   |1   |7
5 |1  |7   |49  |16
4 |0  |16  |38  |38
3 |1  |38  |27  |80
2 |1  |80  |78  |1
1 |0  |1   |1   |1
0 |0  |1   |1   |1
109 is perhaps a prime
