Miller-Rabin Algorithm for testing whether given number is prime or not.
Case 1. Non-prime number given.
n = 121, a = 21
i |xi |z   |y   |y
6 |1  |1   |1   |21
5 |1  |21  |78  |65
4 |1  |65  |111 |32
3 |1  |32  |56  |87
2 |0  |87  |67  |67
1 |0  |67  |12  |12
0 |0  |12  |23  |23
121 is not a prime because 21^120 mod 121 != 1

Case 2. Prime number given.
n = 67, a = 121
i |xi |z   |y   |y
6 |1  |1   |1   |54
5 |0  |54  |35  |35
4 |0  |35  |19  |19
3 |0  |19  |26  |26
2 |0  |26  |6   |6
1 |1  |6   |36  |1
0 |0  |1   |1   |1
67 is perhaps a prime
