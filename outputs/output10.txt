Miller-Rabin Algorithm for testing whether given number is prime or not.
Case 1. Non-prime number given.
n = 111, a = 7
i |xi |z   |y   |y
6 |1  |1   |1   |7
5 |1  |7   |49  |10
4 |0  |10  |100 |100
3 |1  |100 |10  |70
2 |1  |70  |16  |1
1 |1  |1   |1   |7
0 |0  |7   |49  |49
111 is not a prime because 7^110 mod 111 != 1

Case 2. Prime number given.
n = 83, a = 72
i |xi |z   |y   |y
6 |1  |1   |1   |72
5 |0  |72  |38  |38
4 |1  |38  |33  |52
3 |0  |52  |48  |48
2 |0  |48  |63  |63
1 |1  |63  |68  |82
0 |0  |82  |1   |1
83 is perhaps a prime
