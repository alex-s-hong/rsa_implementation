Miller-Rabin Algorithm for testing whether given number is prime or not.
Case 1. Non-prime number given.
n = 81, a = 7
i |xi |z   |y   |y
6 |1  |1   |1   |7
5 |0  |7   |49  |49
4 |1  |49  |52  |40
3 |0  |40  |61  |61
2 |0  |61  |76  |76
1 |0  |76  |25  |25
0 |0  |25  |58  |58
81 is not a prime because 7^80 mod 81 != 1

Case 2. Prime number given.
n = 109, a = 104
i |xi |z   |y   |y
6 |1  |1   |1   |104
5 |1  |104 |25  |93
4 |0  |93  |38  |38
3 |1  |38  |27  |83
2 |1  |83  |22  |108
1 |0  |108 |1   |1
0 |0  |1   |1   |1
109 is perhaps a prime
