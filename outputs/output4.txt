Miller-Rabin Algorithm for testing whether given number is prime or not.
Case 1. Non-prime number given.
n = 77, a = 6
i |xi |z   |y   |y
6 |1  |1   |1   |6
5 |0  |6   |36  |36
4 |0  |36  |64  |64
3 |1  |64  |15  |13
2 |1  |13  |15  |13
1 |0  |13  |15  |15
0 |0  |15  |71  |71
77 is not a prime because 6^76 mod 77 != 1

Case 2. Prime number given.
n = 71, a = 92
i |xi |z   |y   |y
6 |1  |1   |1   |21
5 |0  |21  |15  |15
4 |0  |15  |12  |12
3 |0  |12  |2   |2
2 |1  |2   |4   |13
1 |1  |13  |27  |70
0 |0  |70  |1   |1
71 is perhaps a prime
