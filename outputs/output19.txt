Number|93|00000000000000000000000001011101

Miller-Rabin Algorithm for testing whether given number is prime or not.
Case 1. Non-prime number given.
n = 105, a = 8
i |xi |z   |y   |y
6 |1  |1   |1   |8
5 |1  |8   |64  |92
4 |0  |92  |64  |64
3 |1  |64  |1   |
2 |0  |    |    |
1 |0  |    |    |
0 |0  |    |    |
105 is not a prime because 64^2 mod 105 = 1 and 64 != 1 and 64 != 105 - 1

Case 2. Prime number given.
n = 107, a = 82
i |xi |z   |y   |y
6 |1  |1   |1   |82
5 |1  |82  |90  |104
4 |0  |104 |9   |9
3 |1  |9   |81  |8
2 |0  |8   |64  |64
1 |1  |64  |30  |106
0 |0  |106 |1   |1
107 is perhaps a prime
