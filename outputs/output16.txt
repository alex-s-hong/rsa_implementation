Miller-Rabin Algorithm for testing whether given number is prime or not.
Case 1. Non-prime number given.
n = 125, a = 3
i |xi |z   |y   |y
6 |1  |1   |1   |3
5 |1  |3   |9   |27
4 |1  |27  |104 |62
3 |1  |62  |94  |32
2 |1  |32  |24  |72
1 |0  |72  |59  |59
0 |0  |59  |106 |106
125 is not a prime because 3^124 mod 125 != 1

Case 2. Prime number given.
n = 109, a = 79
i |xi |z   |y   |y
6 |1  |1   |1   |79
5 |1  |79  |28  |32
4 |0  |32  |43  |43
3 |1  |43  |105 |11
2 |1  |11  |12  |76
1 |0  |76  |108 |108
0 |0  |108 |1   |1
109 is perhaps a prime
