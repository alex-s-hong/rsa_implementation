Miller-Rabin Algorithm for testing whether given number is prime or not.
Case 1. Non-prime number given.
n = 77, a = 3
i |xi |z   |y   |y
6 |1  |1   |1   |3
5 |0  |3   |9   |9
4 |0  |9   |4   |4
3 |1  |4   |16  |48
2 |1  |48  |71  |59
1 |0  |59  |16  |16
0 |0  |16  |25  |25
77 is not a prime because 3^76 mod 77 != 1

Case 2. Prime number given.
n = 109, a = 104
i |xi |z   |y   |y
6 |1  |1   |1   |104
5 |1  |104 |25  |93
4 |0  |93  |38  |38
3 |1  |38  |27  |83
2 |1  |83  |22  |108
1 |0  |108 |1   |1
0 |0  |1   |1   |1
109 is perhaps a prime
