Miller-Rabin Algorithm for testing whether given number is prime or not.
Case 1. Non-prime number given.
n = 115, a = 10
i |xi |z   |y   |y
6 |1  |1   |1   |10
5 |1  |10  |100 |80
4 |1  |80  |75  |60
3 |0  |60  |35  |35
2 |0  |35  |75  |75
1 |1  |75  |105 |15
0 |0  |15  |110 |110
115 is not a prime because 10^114 mod 115 != 1

Case 2. Prime number given.
n = 127, a = 91
i |xi |z   |y   |y
6 |1  |1   |1   |91
5 |1  |91  |26  |80
4 |1  |80  |50  |105
3 |1  |105 |103 |102
2 |1  |102 |117 |106
1 |1  |106 |60  |126
0 |0  |126 |1   |1
127 is perhaps a prime
