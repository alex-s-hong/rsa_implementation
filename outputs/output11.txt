Miller-Rabin Algorithm for testing whether given number is prime or not.
Case 1. Non-prime number given.
n = 95, a = 5
i |xi |z   |y   |y
6 |1  |1   |1   |5
5 |0  |5   |25  |25
4 |1  |25  |55  |85
3 |1  |85  |5   |25
2 |1  |25  |55  |85
1 |1  |85  |5   |25
0 |0  |25  |55  |55
95 is not a prime because 5^94 mod 95 != 1

Case 2. Prime number given.
n = 107, a = 86
i |xi |z   |y   |y
6 |1  |1   |1   |86
5 |1  |86  |13  |48
4 |0  |48  |57  |57
3 |1  |57  |39  |37
2 |0  |37  |85  |85
1 |1  |85  |56  |1
0 |0  |1   |1   |1
107 is perhaps a prime
