Number|85|00000000000000000000000001010101

Miller-Rabin Algorithm for testing whether given number is prime or not.
Case 1. Non-prime number given.
n = 75, a = 8
i |xi |z   |y   |y
6 |1  |1   |1   |8
5 |0  |8   |64  |64
4 |0  |64  |46  |46

2 |0  |53  |34  |34
1 |1  |34  |31  |23
0 |0  |23  |4   |4
75 is not a prime because 8^74 mod 75 != 1

Case 2. Prime number given.
n = 101, a = 116
i |xi |z   |y   |y
6 |1  |1   |1   |15
5 |1  |15  |23  |42

2 |1  |88  |68  |10
1 |0  |10  |100 |100
0 |0  |100 |1   |1
101 is perhaps a prime
