Miller-Rabin Algorithm for testing whether given number is prime or not.
Case 1. Non-prime number given.
n = 125, a = 4
i |xi |z   |y   |y
6 |1  |1   |1   |4
5 |1  |4   |16  |64
4 |1  |64  |96  |9
3 |1  |9   |81  |74
2 |1  |74  |101 |29
1 |0  |29  |91  |91
0 |0  |91  |31  |31
125 is not a prime because 4^124 mod 125 != 1

Case 2. Prime number given.
n = 97, a = 91
i |xi |z   |y   |y
6 |1  |1   |1   |91
5 |1  |91  |36  |75
4 |0  |75  |96  |96
3 |0  |96  |1   |1
2 |0  |1   |1   |1
1 |0  |1   |1   |1
0 |0  |1   |1   |1
97 is perhaps a prime
